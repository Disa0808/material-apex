## Project Sponsors
Thanks to [Insum Solutions](http://insum.ca/) for sponsoring this project.

## Install
- **Option 1) Application Import** - *Best for new application*
    - Import **barebone-app.sql** or **demo-app.sql** from the [latest release](https://github.com/vincentmorneau/material-apex/releases/latest) in your workspace.
- **Option 2) Theme Import** - *Best for upgrading existing application*
    - [See documentation](docs/theme-import.md)
    - **IMPORTANT:** Updating a theme is not fully supported by Oracle yet. Upgrading the theme of an existing app dismisses all template options that you might have selected. See:

        - https://community.oracle.com/message/13733156
- **Option 3) Manual install** - *Best for customizing the theme*
    - [See documentation](docs/manual-install.md)

## Changelog
[See complete changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

### v0.9.3 Notice
- The [demo application](https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=12192) documentation was made with screenshots several months ago. (Very bad idea I now realize...)
- That documentation is out-of-sync with the current development
- The next release will focus on making a dynamic documentation for better consistency across future releases
