#Material APEX - Beta
This is a full featured Material Design Theme for APEX 5.

Here's a demo: https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=12192

The APEX application export is included in this repo.

---

##Automatic Install
- Import the APEX application ```12192.sql``` in your workspace.

---

##Manual Install
- Fork the project on Github
- `npm install`
- `bower install materialize`
- `npm start`

You can now use your own Sass (I suggest you take a look at this: https://github.com/vincentmorneau/apex-gulpfile-sass)

---

##Beta Testing
If you find bugs, you can fill an issue through Github, send me a tweet or an email and I'll try to fix them as fast as possible!

It is strongly influenced by http://materializecss.com/  

I am leaning toward a full release shortly after APEX 5.0 is available for public download. 

It will have:

- Better documentation
- More features
- Bugs fixes found in the Beta
- A "showcase" section with adapted applications.
